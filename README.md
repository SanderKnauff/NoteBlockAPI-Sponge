NoteBlockAPI Sponge
============

This is a version of xxmicloxx and michidk's NoteBlockAPI modified to work on SpongeAPI.

Changes in this version include:
* Ported the plugin over to Sponge
* Modified types to accept Player UUIDs instead of PlayerName Strings
* Converted the project to gradle

More information about the original project can be found [here](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/noteblockapi/)
